#  Trust over IP - Documentation and Specification Template
This repo is a [GitHub Repo Template][1] for creating GitHub repositories within the ToIP GitHub Organization. Newly generated repos will contain all the necessary code for using MkDocs for the development of [ToIP Deliverables][2].

The **ToIP MkDocs Material Theme** a ready-to-use setup for a ToIP branded version of [MkDocs][3], a static site generator geared towards (technical) project documentation and specification development. The theme is a customized version of [Material for MkDocs][4].

## Purpose
This repo has been developed to address the [requirements](./REQUIREMENTS.md) of [ToIP Foundation][5] contributors with respect to the [authoring process][6] for [ToIP Deliverables][2].
