DELETE THIS COMMENT ## Reference ```diff - Gating Criteria requirement - URL to be added Normative References \u00b6 The policy for reference lists is: 1. 'ORG_NAME' documents listed should have at least one approved version \u2013 draft-only docs should not be referenced. Exception exists for documents that will be approved with or after the referenced doc is approved (may be part of same enabler package). In short \u2013 approved docs should not reference unapproved docs. 2. When a reference is made to an 'ORG_NAME' specification, then Organization Name with the TM symbol (\u2122) should be used in the description. 3. The name + version (no date) for 'ORG_NAME' specifications are generally sufficient \u2013 dates should be used only if there is a specific reason to limit the usage. 4. For references to WAP Forum docs, dates should not be included as DID's for the old WAP Forum specifications are enough and the reference description should refer to WAP Forum\u2122. 5. References to other affiliate docs should similarly provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the needed document and should provide the appropriate source information. 6. The URL for 'ORG_NAME' material (new 'ORG_NAME' and affiliate) should always be http://www.org_name.org (an exception is Registry that is reached through http://www.org_name.org/tech/) Models to use [REFLABEL] <General Model> \"Ref Title\", Ref information (source, date, id), URL:http//<ref-source>/ ['ORG_NAME'DOC] <'ORG_NAME' Model> \"'ORG_NAME' Document Title\",{ Version x.y,} Organization Name\u2122, 'ORG_NAME' <docname>{ <version>}, URL:http//www.org_name.org/ If there are no entries in the table \u2013 enter \u2018none\u2019 to be clear.
